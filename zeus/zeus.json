Zeus Music even allows you to download any music in mp3 format. \nYou can Set Streaming Quality and also change the appearance of the app upto some extent. You can even play the music video of the song you're listening to, if available. \nZeus Music does not collect any data. All the Musics you like or playlist you create are stored locally in your system that means if you delete the app, everything will be gone. But not to worry my friend I am working on an update through which you can create a backup and store it on your google drive or something. \nZeus Music is an app made for Educational Purpose, I do not suggest you to use it, but if you use then i am not responsible. \n\nAbout me? My name is Hamza, in my free time I like to create something cool.
